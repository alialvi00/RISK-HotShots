Milestone 1

Deliverables included in Milestone 1:
•	The code required for this milestone is packaged in a JAR file (including source files and executables) which will allow the game to be easily played on a different device.
•	UML class diagrams and sequence diagrams corresponding to the code and important features of the game will also be provided. The diagrams will also be located in the appendices of the documentation file.
•	The documentation, which simply encapsulates design decisions, the rules of RISK, and complete user manuals will also be submitted. 
•	All deliverables will be packaged into a well named zip-file.

•	Ali Alvi

Changes Made Since Previous Deliverable:

•	This is the first deliverable and as such, all implementations are new.
This milestone introduced a playable, text-based version of RISK, that provided output from the console as text. The documentation described above, containing the UML and Sequence diagrams, design decisions and a user manual, was also created to allow players to have an understanding of the development methodologies used to create the game, and reasonings as to why certain design implementations and data structures were chosen.

Known Issues:

•	Troops are unable to be maneuvered. This feature was not a requirement in milestone 1, so we chose not to implement it. This will be corrected in milestone 3.
Roadmap Ahead:

Essentially, in milestone 1, we provided an implementation for the “Model” part of the MVC design. In milestone 2, we will create the “View” and “Controller” parts of the MVC while providing unit tests for the model. This will of course, result in necessary changes that will be made and added to the Model, UML diagrams and documentation. We will also implement the feedback provided to us by the TA assigned to our group.
